## About

Hi friend!

I'm Wing-Sum, a mechanical engineering research fellow with an interest in mechanical engineering design and soft, plastic materials. I currently research biomaterials and cell migration in [the Chaudhuri Lab](https://chaudhurilab.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Stanford University.

**As I grow in mechanical engineering expertise, I have realized my passion for engineering applications in storytelling, including digital art, grant writing, and space design.** I am looking for an internship in which I can bring my mechanical expertise to learning more about design.

When not in lab, you might find me...

* dancing with [Stanford Dv8](https://stanforddv8.wixsite.com/stanforddv8){:target="_blank"},
* drawing,
* running a Dungeons & Dragons game,
* writing grants for [BioJam](https://biojamcamp.weebly.com/){:target="_blank"},
* or relaxing with my [rabbits](/rabbits.html)

I try not to take myself too seriously :)
