## About

Hi! I'm Wing-Sum, a mechanical engineering PhD student with an interest in mechanical engineering applications to human biology. I currently research biophysics of cell migration in [the Chaudhuri Lab](https://chaudhurilab.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Stanford University.

When not in lab, you might find me...

* dancing with [Stanford Dv8](https://stanforddv8.wixsite.com/stanforddv8){:target="_blank"},
* drawing,
* coding,
* or relaxing with my [rabbits](/rabbits.html)

I try not to take myself too seriously :)
