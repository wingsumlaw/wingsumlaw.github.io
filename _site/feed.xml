&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been taking a lot of walks around the neighborhood and enjoying the scenery of my neighbors’ yards. I have particularly enjoyed yards in which it is clear the owners have deliberately planted native plants. In an area as drought-stricken as California, planting natives can help conserve water, reduce maintenance, and encourage local pollinators. Makes sense – the plants would have been living here anyway without us humans!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, along with some inspiration from the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.ooo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MICRO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://biojamcamp.weebly.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BioJam&lt;/a&gt;, led me to wonder: how might we create a fun, interactive, community exhibit based on the celebration of native plant life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ideation&quot;&gt;Ideation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began with some inspiration from the California coastal oak tree. Often when thinking of the trees of California one might first consider the redwoods, but its very vertical aspect ratio makes it difficult to properly display plants. The coastal oak tree is equally magnificent, and its wider branches make for a more accessible platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nativetree_collage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Planter Ideation&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the actual structure, I wanted to create something that balanced the grandeur of viewing a tree with accessibility so those of most viewing heights can enjoy it. I also liked the idea of building planters that emulated the rings of a tree and the wide reach of the coastal oak’s branches. Finally, I wanted it to be possible for a community with some handiworkers to assemble it themselves: imagine a beautiful afternoon during which members of the community garden or local elementary school put together their very own Native Tree Mini-Museum, and the kids are able to plant some native plants themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these requirements in mind, I began drafting 3D models using CAD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3d-models&quot;&gt;3D Models&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I had originally imagined huge rings of planters hanging like branches off of the main structure, I quickly realized that a massive round planter would be prohibitive to both ship and assemble. I thus altered my original design to be an octagonal structure – still quasi-circular in feel, yet able to break down into flat parts for shipping and assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nativetree_view1.png&quot; alt=&quot;View 1&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I realized that in order to actually enjoy the plants in the planters they could not be that high off of the ground. I spent some time familiarizing myself with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://access.si.edu/museum-professionals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Smithsonian’s guides&lt;/a&gt; for creating accessible exhibits, and came to the conclusion that the bottom layer should be 30” high at max and that there should be a ramp for viewing the top layer of the tree, with the top layer also being 30” above the ramp platform at max. I also incorporated signage for the various layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nativetree_view2.png&quot; alt=&quot;View 2&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my imagination, communities with access to branches from the local flora could incorporate those into the supports between platforms. This idea would need further consideration and discussion with local experts and community leaders on feasibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;designing-for-transport-and-assembly&quot;&gt;Designing for Transport and Assembly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the above section, I created the shape of the tree with shipping and assembly in mind. While assembly would still require some tools and would certainly be made easier with the help of an experienced woodworker, I wanted to create an assembly with consistent, standardized parts that could pack flat into a shipping container and be assembled on site with basic tools. With some inspiration from a certain Scandinavian furniture company, I was able to come up with a set of standardized wooden boards, connectors, and slats that can (hopefully) be intuitively assembled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nativetree_exploded.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flatpack Exploded&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly, all screws and washers are avilable on McMaster-Carr and basic mechanical analysis shows that the fasteners and construction should easily support the weight of the wood as well as the dirt and plants eventually going into the planter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a first pass at creating an easy to assemble construction. I would want to actually interview and workshop with potential users before finalizing this assembly design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plants&quot;&gt;The Plants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the fun part of this whole thing – the plants! Plenty of resources are available online (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnps.org/gardening&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;like this webpage&lt;/a&gt;) for determining appropriate plants for a native plant garden depending on the amount of sunlight and climate of your surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I believe that the most interactive and exciting way to go about putting the plant touches on this exhibit is to hire a local horticulturist or botanist and educator to instruct participants on the local flora and how it responds to the environment. That way the whole process can be based in the community members, leading to a greater sense of ownership and pride.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="design" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Work in Progress – Folding Rocking Chair</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2021/02/20/rocking-chair.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Work in Progress – Folding Rocking Chair" /><published>2021-02-20T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-02-20T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2021/02/20/rocking-chair</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2021/02/20/rocking-chair.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/thumbs/20210220.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rocking Chair Render&quot; class=&quot;half&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was enjoying our rocking chair in the apartment when I came to two realizations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would be nice to transport this experience to an outdoor gathering and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would be nice if this chair didn’t take up so much floor space when it wasn’t being used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all led me to ask the question: how might we create a transportable, floor-space friendly rocking chair?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this project is still in a relatively early phase, with physical modeling and kinematic design iteration still necessary. Still, I’d love to share where I am at right now, and showcase a little of my design thought process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/rockingchair_collage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rocking Chair Ideation&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to create a folding rocking chair. Now, folding rocking chairs already exist out there. But there are a few obvious problems to me about the ones that are already out there. For one, they’re all aesthetically lacking. Most of the ones I was able to find have a plastic beach chair or camping chair look about them. While that does mean that they are made out of a sporty, light material, I would love to include shapes that feel more modern. Secondly, it is not immediately obvious how all of them fold. It is my belief that products ought to feel intuitive and natural when using them. For example, consider the basic, metal folding chair we’ve all experienced at various seminars and school assemblies in our lives. While it was not comfortable or aesthetically pleasing, it is very obvious how it folds up: one pull on the seat collapses the whole structure into an easily store-able form. How might we include that in our folding rocking chair design?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/thumbs/20210220an.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Chair Kinematics&quot; class=&quot;half&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly my first pass at this chair has failed on pretty much all of the requirements I set out for myself. It does not improve much aesthetically speaking on the already existing forms, and it has far too many degrees of freedom to be considered user friendly. I will need to go back to the drawing board. For now, I am considering the various forms of link kinematics I have studied as a mechanical engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I have the added constraints of the rockers on the bottom and my own desire to include an armrest, the links are going to be more complicated than your standard folding chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/rockingchair_more.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;More Ideas&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to &lt;em&gt;break out of the standard folding chair form entirely&lt;/em&gt;. Could a rocking chair that accordions on itself across its midline be feasible here? This is another interesting possibility I might explore further. One question would be how to create an accordion chair that minimizes material (for lower weight) and can also stand up to the possible fatigue resulting from constantly being bent and then widened again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this project would benefit greatly from physical iteration in addition to computer modeling. Unfortunately, due COVID19, I do not have access to the makerspaces I might normally have. Instead, I may make some cardboard models in the future as a way of physically prototyping in the current constraints of life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="design" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Recovered Art</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2021/02/04/recovered-art.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Recovered Art" /><published>2021-02-04T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-02-04T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2021/02/04/recovered-art</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2021/02/04/recovered-art.html">&lt;p&gt;I used to paint a lot, and recently uncovered some watercolors I did several years ago.

Below are some of my depictions of those proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nucleus-during-cell-migration&quot;&gt;Nucleus during Cell Migration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nucleus is the largest and stiffest organelle in cells. Thus, when cells migrate – often through confined spaces – the nucleus is often the limiting factor as to how small of a space through which a cell can squeeze. First, it is fairly evident during migration that the nucleus does deform. One question that has yet to be answered is whether that nuclear deformation is a result of internal forces or external forces. Another is whether or not that nucleus deformation might be used to pressurize and thus expand protrusions from the migrating cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/qual.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nucleus Deformation&quot; class=&quot;half&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of possible mechanisms by which this may occur. In order to investigate these mechanisms, one must observe nuclear deformation and positioning during migration, measure other dimensions of the cell such as protrusion width, and perturb proteins potentially involved in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/qual-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nucleus Deformation Paths&quot; class=&quot;half&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that there is DNA damage after nuclear deformation. I also proposed visualizing DNA damage and comparing that to the timing of nuclear deformations and nuclear protein movement during cell migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/qual-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;DNA Damage&quot; class=&quot;half&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;endometriotic-invasion-through-cell-monolayer&quot;&gt;Endometriotic Invasion through Cell Monolayer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In endometriosis, lesions of endometriotic tissue are often found outside of the uterus. In some cases, these lesions are embedded in the smooth tissue that lines the peritoneal space (i.e. the sac that holds many of your organs). This project proposes observing cell invasion through a monolayer of other cells and analyzing monolayer and gel substrate deformation during migration as a proxy for force generation on the part of the migrating cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

But what do they actually look like? And why should biologists care about these properties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an interactive exploration of the ways we mathematically describe viscoelasticity and plasticity. Please note that this demonstration is geared toward those who have studied &lt;em&gt;college level mechanics of materials&lt;/em&gt;. The math could be quite difficult if you haven’t taken it before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We represent the different parameters of a material as a series of dashpots and springs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;yield stress&lt;/strong&gt; of a material is the stress at which a material will begin to deform plastically&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The elastic nature of a material is represented by &lt;strong&gt;springs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The viscous nature of a material is represented by &lt;strong&gt;dashpots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
